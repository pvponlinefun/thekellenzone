        <h2>Apple Vision Pro Release Date Announced!</h2>
        <p class="article">Great (kind of) news! The Apple Vision Pro is officially releasing on November 2nd, and will be available for pre-order starting January 19th at 5AM (PT). The bad news: the price starts at a whopping $3,500.</p>

        <p class="article">The Apple Vision Pro, for those who dont already know, is an AR headset (meaning you can see your surroundings) which will be compatible for most apps you might be familiar with using on a Mac or iPhone. Examples of use-cases for the Apple Vision Pro are watching movies in an immersive environment (or in the same environment, but with a giant, or tiny, screen in front of you), getting work done with productivity apps such as FaceTime, notes, safari, mail (you name it!), or even taking photos and videos with the high-resolution cameras (capable of taking and viewing spatial videos, which can also be taken on the iPhone 15 Pro).
        </p>
        
        <p class="article">The headset features eye tracking, spatial audio, a screen with 23 million pixels, and a battery life of 2 hours with general use, or 2.5 hours of watching video (ouch).
        </p>
        
        <p class="article">Apple just recently released a video teasing the release of the Apple Vision Pro, featuring a similar style to the original iPhone “Hello” video. Could this signal the future of computing? When thinking about phones before and after the iPhone, or computers after the Mac was released, the Apple Vision Pro could cause yet another major impact to the tech industry.
