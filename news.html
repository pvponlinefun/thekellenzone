        <h2>Cybertruck Official Release!</h2>
        <p class="article">Welcome back to the weekly news! This weeks story is on the Tesla Cybertruck, and how I think it will hold up on the market.</p>

        <p class="article">The Tesla Cybertruck was announced in November of 2019, with the memorable smashing of two windows which were said to be indestructible. The vehicle itself is almost completely made of stainless steel alloy which Tesla designed themselves, which brings up a point of concern, because as many have noticed, it might not be completely flush, meaning there might be pieces sticking out too much. Technology YouTuber Marques Brownlee, also known as MKBHD, has noted that stainless steel was positioned slightly differently on several vehicles, some being nearly flush and others being quite worse. In addition to this, the front hood space is quite small, it only has enough space for two small carry-ons. Compared to other EVs like the Rivian R1T, this is a disappointment.</p>
        
        <p class="article">Moving away from the negatives, lets look at the positives of the Tesla Cybertruck. It is available in three options: a rear-wheel drive option (0-60 6.5 sec, 250 mi range), an all-wheel drive option (340 mi range, 0-60 4.1 sec), and the “Cyberbeast” option (320 mi range, 0-60 in just 2.6 sec). It has a quite large bed and a powered tonneau cover, which can hold up to 300 pounds (this has been confirmed by MKBHD). If you are driving the truck and the cover is up, you will not get any rear visibility. Instead, you have to refer to the 18.5-inch touchscreen beside the steering wheel. The rearview mirror is not digital, so you cannot refer to that either. The Cybertruck can handle most tasks you throw at it, such as shooting it with a gun, drag racing a Porsche 911 while towing a 911, or even out-towing other trucks with a 35,000-pound attachment on the back.</p>
