        <h2>Jason, AKA Walkingblock Biography</h2>
        <p class="article">
            Hey, do you know Jason? Hes also known as Walkingblock on Discord. Hes a cool guy who has a lot of hobbies and skills. He thinks that the world “levelled up” when he was born on February 11, 2009. Hes into coding, war vehicles, and barbecue (kind of idk). He supports the communist party on Solara, he hates furries, and he likes Myron Mixon, who he met in real life.</p>
        <p class="article">  Jason loves coding since he was a kid (probably). He knows how to code in Python, Lua, and HTML, and he makes all kinds of cool stuff with them. He likes to figure out how things work, make algorithms, and design interfaces. He always wants to learn more and get better at coding.</p>
        <p class="article">Jason is also into war vehicles, because he likes history and strategy. He plays War Thunder, a game that has all kinds of military vehicles from different times and places. He really likes the AC-130, a big plane that can shoot a lot of bullets. He knows a lot about different war vehicles, and how to use them in the game.            
        </p>
        <p class="article">As for Jasons appearence on Discord as Walkingblock, he first joined the community in Resoland, which was our original main chatting server. He has taken part in fighting for Ayush's communist party against the Democrats. He has also been involved in the development of other servers, and is responsible for some *minor* trolling. In addition to this,
            he recently finished development on a new Servoria-exclusive bot called Server Points! This allows members of the community to take part in games of trivia or risk to have the chance at winning big! These points allow users to purchase rewards directly from the server or from user-curated shops. Check it out!
        </p>
        <p class="article">All in all, Walkingblock is a dedicated and highly active member of the community, who is probably the reason any of our servers are still active. Yay idk how to end this bye!!</p>
