        <h2>Apple Upcoming Plans for M4 Processor</h2>
        <p class="article">Apple plans to release MBAs with M4 chips in early 2025, according to Bloomberg.</p>
        <p class="article">Just this spring the M3 chips were announced, but the M4 will most likely launch between January and March 2025.</p>
        <p class="article">Both the 13 and 15-inch models will get the M4 chip along with a similar design to the M2 Air.</p>
        <p class="article">This means that the MBA line will likely not be part of the rumored announcement next week, but they will update Macbook Pros, Mac Minis, and iMacs.</p>
        <p class="article">Since the Mac Studio is currently using the M2 Max/Ultra, the M4 release could arrive after a March software release, meaning sometime between March and June. Apple is also working on an M4 Mac Pro, but no timeline was provided.</p>
        <p class="article">In the spring, Apple is rumored to reveal a new iPhone SE, iPad Airs, upgraded iPad keyboards, and new entry level iPads. They also just release a seventh-gen iPad Mini, set to launch with the first phase of Apple Intelligence next week.</p>
