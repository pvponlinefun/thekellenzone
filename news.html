        <h2>Nintendo Switch 2 Review</h2>
        <p class="article">After many years of waiting and some horrible (or somewhat accurate) early predictions, the next Nintendo console is finally here, the Nintendo Switch 2. I got a launch console and I would like to share my initial thoughts on it after spending a few weeks with it.</p>
        <p class="article">The switch 2 provides many much needed upgrades over the switch 1, including an improved LCD, real kickstand, two USB-C ports, and a much better processor. </p>
        <p class="article">To address the elephant in the room, this is an LCD, not an OLED display. The likely reason for this is because Nintendo is probably going to be releasing a Switch 2 OLED console some time later in its life cycle for 500 dollars. The LCD in the Switch 2 is a very nice screen though, and is very close in quality to the Switch OLED. This display supports 120Hz and HDR, and is definitely a solid upgrade over the Switch 1 display. I think where the OLED still stands out is the range of colors compared to an LCD, based on what I’ve seen online.</p>
        <p class="article">The new dock for the Switch 2 allows for 4K gaming (yay Nintendo, you finally caught up!) and HDR. The dock itself has a fan for cooling, but this fan seems to be only used for the dock as many, including myself, have noticed the switch 2 runs warm while docked. The new Joy-Cons both have mouse sensors which I have used once on the Home menu and never again. I could see the potential for FPS games but it mostly seems like a useless gimmick, at least to me anyways, because this is surprisingly becoming a fan favorite feature of the Switch 2. As with the console itself, the Joy cons are bigger than the original and feel much better to hold, along with new shoulder buttons that allow for much easier gameplay with the single joy con. The switch pro controller still works with the Switch 2 but will not power on the console from sleep mode. </p>
        <p class="article">The switch 2 only had 2 official Nintendo games on launch, which are Mario Kart World and Welcome tour (if you can even count that). Some other games include Switch 2 editions of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, Cyberpunk, Hogwarts Legacy Switch 2 edition (this will make a huge difference compared to switch 1), FAST Fusion, and some others. While the switch 2 has decent specs for a handheld it is still about as powerful as a PS4, but despite this games have been running quite well on the system especially when docked. </p>
        <p class="article">I think the price of the switch 2 is justified. If the switch is 300 dollars and the OLED 350, this is a reasonable price increase for substantially improved hardware. I will next get into my review of Mario Kart World, and explain if I think it is worth 80 dollars or not.</p>
        <p class="article">So far Mariokart World is the only Switch 2 exclusive game I have, because I got it with the bundle. It has 7 grand prix cups, and if you play all of them you can unlock another cup that includes the newest addition to the Rainbow Road races. It has 50, 100, and 150cc as well as an unlockable mirror mode. No 200cc. I find the 24 player racing to be much more chaotic than just 12 racers, especially online. When racing in grand prix mode, there isn’t the traditional option to change difficulty, it seems like it automatically adapts difficulty based on the player skill. Some have suggested that it changes based on how much the player drifts. The CPU players definitely feel harder in this game compared to MK8D, but experienced players will likely still find it easy. Knockout tour is a new game mode in Mario Kart World where you have to maintain your position throughout the race to get to the finish. At the start, you need to maintain a 20th or better place until the next checkpoint, and each checkpoint the number reduces by 4 places. This is a surprisingly difficult game mode, even when playing offline, because getting “Mario Karted” in this game mode can have a severe impact. Unfortunately battle mode only includes coin runners and balloon battle, meaning renegade roundup has not returned to the game. I expect these to be added possibly in a future DLC, like the booster pass.</p>
        <p class="article">Free roam is surprisingly useful and fun. There are many secrets to find and collectibles, like Peach Medallions and ? blocks. There are also P switches which unlock timed missions that are placed throughout each course on the map. So far it is confirmed that there are about 300 P switches, so you definitely won’t finish them all too quickly. Free roam is also useful for practicing difficult shortcuts or meeting up with friends on GameChat. This game introduces new mechanics such as a charge jump, wall riding, and rail grinding, which are much more difficult than they seem! They provide a new challenge to the Mario Kart series and mastering the technique can really benefit the racer. </p>
        <p class="article">Is Mario Kart world worth 80 dollars? Definitely not. How is Gran Turismo 7, one of the most realistic simulators with real cars and real tracks, cheaper than a Mario Kart game? Free roam is great but this game should definitely be 60 dollars. I think the bundle, however, is absolutely worth it. You are only paying 50 dollars for this game, which I think is a great deal for what you’re getting. DK Bananza is planned to release at 70 dollars, and it looks like a very promising game based on the Direct.</p>
        <p class="article">As for availability on launch, I think Nintendo figured out making more consoles is actually good for sales. Availability on launch day was insane, even hours and days after launch people were still seeing consoles available in stores. Some people even had more luck finding a console in store than preordering it. I know Target delayed most orders but Walmart locked in and even gave chips and a drink in the package. I didn’t get a preorder but I showed up at Target, and they had plenty of consoles for everyone. I know Costco currently has orders available right now and some might even still be in stores.</p>
        <p class="article">I think the Switch 2 is definitely worth it for Switch or Switch Lite owners looking for an upgrade. If you have the OLED, it might be worth a wait, but if this is your first Nintendo console, definitely go for the Switch 2 over the Switch.</p>
