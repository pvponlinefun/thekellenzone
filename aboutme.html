            Hey, my name is Kellen Lorenz, and I am the creator of this glorious website. My interests are gaming, learning programming/computer science skills, tennis, and skiing.</p>
        <p class="article">
            I made this website to test my skills on HTML and CSS, but also to provide you with a fun, new experience most weeks which are always new and exciting! I am constantly learning more about HTML and CSS, so expect new additions to the website pretty often!
        </p>
        <p class="article">
            Thanks for joining me on this journey of learning and fun, and I hope to see you again!
